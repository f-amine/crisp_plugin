If you are starting a new product promotion, reviews for that product may already be available elsewhere on the internet.

That's why we made it possible for you to import reviews in one click.

We currently support reviews from AliExpress.

1.  Choose `Products`, click `Reviews` then `Import`.
2.  Select a product to import reviews for
3.  Paste the AliExpress product link
4.  Choose the language, images and rating filters
5.  Select the reviews you would like to import
6.  Click import

Your reviews are now imported and you can see them on your product.
