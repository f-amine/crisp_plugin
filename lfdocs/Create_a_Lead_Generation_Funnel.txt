Lead Gen Funnel Creation

Choose a theme for your funnel then click `Create my Funnel`.

Enter a name for your funnel and a URL then click `Open the Funnel`.

You have now created a funnel and opened it in the funnel builder.

A lead generation funnel is composed of a Squeeze Page and a Thank You page. A common practice is to have a Squeeze Page in front of an e-commerce funnel.

Now you can open each page in the [Page Builder](https://docs.lightfunnels.com/tag/page-builder/) to edit it to your liking.
