Email configuration[](#email-configuration)
-------------------------------------------

To allow Lightfunnels to send emails on your behalf, you need to add these 2 TXT records to your DNS settings.

Under your DNS records, add the following:

| Type | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TXT | domain.com | v=spf1 a mx include:relay.mailchannels.net ~all |
| TXT | \_mailchannels | v=mc1 cfid=mylightfunnels.workers.dev |

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

If you already have an SPF record, simply add `include:relay.mailchannels.net` to this entry. Make sure to add it BEFORE the ‚Äúall‚Äù mechanism as ‚Äúall‚Äù always matches and typically goes at the end of the SPF record.

That's it! Now you should be able to set the `Order Email Updates` app to send emails from your own domain.
