**Consistent Currency Transactions**: Ensure that payments made through MercadoPago align with the currency of your registered MercadoPago account. For example, if your account is associated with the Argentine Peso, all transactions should be conducted in this currency.

### Aligning Your Online Store's Currency:[](#aligning-your-online-stores-currency)

Your online store or sales funnel's currency should mirror the currency of your MercadoPago account.
