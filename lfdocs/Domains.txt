Connecting your domain name to LightFunnels allows you to hide the lightfunnels branding from your storefront, making your pages look more professional.

To add a custom domain name, make sure you register your domain name at a domain registrar such as [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or any domain name service of your choice.

Once done, go to your LightFunnels settings and choose Domains.

Click `Add Custom Domain` then enter your domain name or subdomain.

Now you need to edit your domain name's DNS records so that your root domain name ( e.g. yourwebsite.com ) or subdomain name ( e.g. funnels.yourwebsite.com ) points to your LightFunnels account.

Setting up your root domain ( yourwebsite.com )[](#setting-up-your-root-domain-yourwebsitecom)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1. Set your www DNS record:[](#step-1-set-your-www-dns-record)

1.  Log in to your domain name service
2.  Choose your domain name
3.  Look for the DNS settings
4.  You need to add the following DNS settings.

| Type | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CNAME | www | shop.mylightfunnels.com |

If a DNS setting with the same name and type already exists, you will need to update its value. Now your main domain (www.yourwebsite.com) is setup.

### Step 2. Redirect your root domain to www[](#step-2-redirect-your-root-domain-to-www)

The second step is adding a redirection from your root domain (website.com) to your www.

Look for the redirection option in your domain settings and set up a redirection from website.com to www.website.com.

If you are asked which type of redirection you want to do, choose 301 permanent redirect.

Setting up your subdomain ( go.yourwebsite.com )[](#setting-up-your-subdomain-goyourwebsitecom)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to only point a subdomain to your LightFunnels account, without changing your main domain, login to your domain name service then go to the DNS settings of your domain and add a CNAME like this:

| Type | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CNAME | funnels | shop.mylightfunnels.com |

This will result in a subdomain like `funnels.yourwebsite.com`. You can change "funnels" to any subdomain that you want.

Verify your domain on LightFunnels[](#verify-your-domain-on-lightfunnels)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go back to your account and go Settings -> Domains then click verify next to your domain name.

Keep in mind that the DNS propagation can take from a few minutes to 72 hours. So your changes may or may not appear on LightFunnels right away.
