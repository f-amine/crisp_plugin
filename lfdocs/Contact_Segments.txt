Segments are a way of organizing your contacts into groups.

Each segment can include or exclude contacts based on their tags.

You can set your contacts tagging from the subscribe button or the buy button inside the page builder.

Set up your tagging inside the action button settings.

Now whenever a visitor fills the above contact form, they will be tagged with the `subscribed` tag.

You can create a segment for your subscribers and set the filter to only include contacts that have the `subscribed` tag.

This segment will contain all the contacts that have the `subscribed` tag
