Your customers and leads are added to your account as contacts. To access your contacts, click the `Contacts` tab on the sidebar.

The `All Contacts` page shows a list of all customers and leads. You can click a contact to get more information about that person.

Contacts can be customers if they have at least one order or leads if they have just subscribed by submitting their personal information.

Using [integrations](https://docs.lightfunnels.com/integrations/), you can automatically sync your new contacts with third party providers like email services or webinar platforms.
