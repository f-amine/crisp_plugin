When your customer starts filling the checkout form, a checkout is created.

After 15 minutes, if the customer has not completed the checkout process, the checkout is considered abandoned. Abandoned checkouts are listed under Orders -> Abandoned Checkouts.

You can recover abandoned checkouts using [abandoned checkout emails in the settings](https://docs.lightfunnels.com/emails/).
