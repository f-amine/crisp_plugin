What is it?[](#what-is-it)
--------------------------

Facebook’s CAPI allows you to send pixel events directly to servers, bypassing browser limitations or ad blockers. This means that you can get more accurate data on your website’s traffic and conversions, and create better ads that are more likely to reach your target audience.

*   Note: Please be advised that your Lightfunnels statistics and Facebook data might not match up. Tracking platforms frequently employ diverse technologies and methodologies, which results in disparities.

*   Note: Any cache or cookies that might be hung up on your browser should be removed Lightfunnels will start to send CAPI events along with the browser events.
*   Note: Please make sure you have your pixel added in the classic Facebook pixels section here, as this is what you will use in your Funnels settings
