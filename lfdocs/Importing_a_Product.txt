If you already have a product on your Shopify store or would like to use a product from AliExpress, you can easily import your products to LightFunnels.

To import a product, go to `Products` on the sidebar then click `Import`.

Copy the product page link from Shopify or AliExpress and paste it in the box then click `Import`.

The product will then be imported with its title, description, images and variants.

You can also [import AliExpress reviews](https://docs.lightfunnels.com/importing-product-reviews/).
