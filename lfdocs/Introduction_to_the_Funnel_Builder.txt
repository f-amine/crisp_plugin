Funnel Page Types[](#funnel-page-types)
---------------------------------------

There are several page types that you can choose from. Each page type can be used for a different purpose.

We go over each page type in details on the [Funnel Page Types](https://docs.lightfunnels.com/funnel-pages/) page.

Page Links[](#page-links)
-------------------------

Links, buttons and forms in your pages appear on the Funnel Builder as a blue circle. You can click and drag each link onto another page to create a connection or onto a blank area to create a new page and connect it to your link.

Linked pages

Funnel Styles[](#funnel-styles)
-------------------------------

Funnel styles allow you to keep your styling congruent throughout all the funnel pages. By changing a color or size here, it also gets changed on all the page elements that use that same style.

Analytics[](#analytics)
-----------------------

On each page on the funnel builder, you can see the page visits, your CTR (click through rate) and number of clicks on that page.

This data helps you find out where your visitors are dropping and pin point areas that need to be fixed in order to improve performance.

This data is related to a time frame that can be changed by clicking the icon on the bottom left corner of the funnel builder.
