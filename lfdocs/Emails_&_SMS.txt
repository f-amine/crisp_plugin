Abandoned Checkouts Emails[](#abandoned-checkouts-emails)

Abandoned Checkouts Emails are sent after a delay when an [Abandoned Checkout](https://docs.lightfunnels.com/abandoned-checkouts/) is created. They allow you to recover an abandoned checkout by sending the customer a link to complete their payment.

Each email as its own analytics.

*   Conversion Rate - The percentage of times this email was successful at recovering a customer.
