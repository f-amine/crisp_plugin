### sara laafissi (5/16/2024, 3:37:04 PM)

?

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/16/2024, 3:41:17 PM)

Hi there, 
you can create a store and link it with an extra domain, you can't use domain with the funnel and store simultaneously 

the domain should either be used with store or funnels not both at the same time

### sara laafissi (5/16/2024, 3:42:37 PM)

so i have to buy another domain and set up a store

### sara laafissi (5/16/2024, 3:43:36 PM)

but the funnel that i have created before  with the other domain i can work with it also or not.

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/16/2024, 3:45:51 PM)

You can work with this domain if it's not linked with the funnel, the domain can't be used with funnels and store at the same time

All plans offer the option to utilize funnels and store at the same time

For the Newbie plan, you have unlimited funnels, 1 free store and  1 domain 

For the Standard and COD plans, you have unlimited funnels, 3 free store and  3 domains 

please note, each extra domain will cost you 3$ monthly

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/16/2024, 4:03:00 PM)

### sara laafissi (5/16/2024, 4:06:57 PM)

I told you that now what I have to do is wait for the funnel domain to be activated and to create the store. I have to buy a new domain and link it to the store?then i can work with the 2 domain one of the store and the other of the funnel

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/16/2024, 4:08:49 PM)

Yes exactly :$
