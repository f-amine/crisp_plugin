I can't add upsell to any product of this store because the store template doesn't contain an upsell page which is weird

### Otmane Mohcine Hamlili (4/30/2024, 3:23:41 PM)

I tried to create an upsell page with the builder but can't and the store pages are kinda locked

### Yousra Chanaoui (4/30/2024, 3:23:41 PM)

what's the name of the store please

### Otmane Mohcine Hamlili (4/30/2024, 3:24:06 PM)

the store name is "Allure" under the account "Local COD"

### Yousra Chanaoui (4/30/2024, 3:24:34 PM)

okay this is weird, that's not how it should look

### Yousra Chanaoui (4/30/2024, 3:24:57 PM)

you need to delete that store and create a new one

### Yousra Chanaoui (4/30/2024, 3:25:23 PM)

I have come across this issue before, when creating a store it gives zero page

### Yousra Chanaoui (4/30/2024, 3:25:38 PM)
