Hi, which Social Proof Tools would you suggest to use on Lightfunnels?

### Aydan Arabadzha (5/20/2024, 11:53:57 AM)

By that I mean, those pop-ups that say "Sara P. has just bought xx product from Australia".

### Adam slam (5/20/2024, 11:54:17 AM)

Also another question, I'm tring to setup useproof, it tells me to add their pixel on every page of the website in its header. If I put it on Stores -> Femglow -> General -> Custom scripts, is it the same? Or should I really add it on every page one by one?

### Adam slam (5/20/2024, 12:22:54 PM)

You can it in the custom script it will reflect for all pages in store

Hi Yousra,

It's not about editing the link, I'd like to know the full url of the
"thankyoupage" page. Because I have to provide it to useproof software. See

Hi, I'd like to take the product page from my store & use it as a funnel with different language, instead of creating a whole new funnel page, is that possible?
