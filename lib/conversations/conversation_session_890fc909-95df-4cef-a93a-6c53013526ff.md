can you tell me, what you can do with the shopify app/integration?

Can i import products from shopify into lightfunnels?

Can i send all orders from lightfunnels back to shopify (for our fulfilment apps)?

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 5:25:36 PM)

That's exactly what the app does 
importing product and collections 


and helps you to sync orders from Lightfunnels store to shopify which allow you to use your fulfillment apps

ok great thanks

### visitor1063970 (5/25/2024, 5:34:48 PM)

is there any way to link the checkout to shopify payments, to send the customer back to the shopify checkout?

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 5:37:59 PM)

this option is not supported, and it's against our terms of use
