Hello there,

I recently submitted a request through Luma concerning our attendance at LF Connect, but I have not received a response yet. We are a registered company in Morocco, and as co-founders, we kindly request two tickets instead of one.

Your assistance with this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
