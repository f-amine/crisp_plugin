when it comes to analyzing data, different platforms and tools use different metrics to measure engagement and user activity. For example, Facebook may use "content views" as a metric, while Lightfunnels might use "sessions."



Because of these variations in metrics, it's quite common for the data between platforms to not match up perfectly. Don't worry, this doesn't mean that anything is necessarily wrong with the data. It simply means that different platforms are measuring and reporting data in their own unique ways.



It's always a good practice to consider the specific metrics being used by each platform or tool when comparing data. This will help you better understand and interpret the variations you may come across.



If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask. Happy analyzing!
