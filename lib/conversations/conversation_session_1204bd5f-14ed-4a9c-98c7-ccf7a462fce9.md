Perhaps you are close to reaching the end of your trial 

You can cancel the subscription, and you will not be charged when your free trial is over

Your account is already locked and in order to delete the account you need to pay the pending invoice

At the end of your free trial, your account automatically transitions to a paid plan. Your account was locked because it wasn't linked to a valid credit card.

Only paying users can delete their accounts to prevent the creation of multiple accounts and evasion of invoices.

Your account is currently locked.
