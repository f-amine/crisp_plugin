Hello,
I want to give a product Y as a gift when a client purchase the product X (without specifying the product Y), Is there a way to do that within LF?

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/24/2024, 3:58:56 PM)

Unfortunately, that's not possible at the moment

ok I have another question plz
I noticed that I can't use my main domain name with the store. I got a message that it is already used on funnnels. Why can't I use the same domain on store and funnels?

hada machi error only note, bli if you link this domain with your store, it's unavailable for use in your funnels 

because the domain should either be used with store or funnels not both at the same time

this is bad 
why it is not possible to use the same domain on both.
a client could remember the name of my store et tape it directly on the navigation bar it should redirect to the store.
i don't understand the why!!!!

When a customer types your store's name into the browser, it needs to know where to go. If your funnel and store share the same domain, it might confuse the browser. Using different domains or subdomains helps clarify where each destination is located

When a customer types your store's name directly into the navigation, the browser needs to know exactly where to take them. If both your funnel and store share the same domain, it could cause confusion for the browser. By using different domains or subdomains, you make it clear where each destination is

Hi Youssef,

weezlo.com

### Youssef KAMIL (5/25/2024, 6:51:13 PM)

FYI the other platforms allow the use of the same domain for the store front (home page, collections, product pages, etc), and for the landing pages as well

Your domain is not currently linked with any funnel or store 

To link it with a funnel : Go to Account Settings > Domains> set home funnel 

To link it with a store: Go to Store Settings> domains

Re Hafsa, 
sorry but you're not responding to my request
I already have my funnels linked to my my domain (example : https://www.weezlo.com/bluetooth-speaker).

### Youssef KAMIL (5/26/2024, 1:10:31 PM)

My request is : when visitor type www.weezlo.com, I want them to go to my store front (home page, collections, etc).
I cant do that with with lightfunnels, I have to make a choice to either use my domain with the store front or either use it with funnels. 
this is a stupid restriction. WHY is that way on LF???

### Adam slam (5/26/2024, 1:11:44 PM)

hi there , this how its work domain can only work for one section (store or funnels)

### Youssef KAMIL (5/26/2024, 1:11:58 PM)

WHY ???

### Adam slam (5/26/2024, 1:12:51 PM)

each domain must have 1 connection with the domain provider , you cant connect same domain for different websites

### Youssef KAMIL (5/26/2024, 1:13:13 PM)

it is the same website

### Adam slam (5/26/2024, 1:13:58 PM)

store and funnels its 2 different structure

### Youssef KAMIL (5/26/2024, 1:14:55 PM)

this is bad Adam. It shouldn't be that way!

### Adam slam (5/26/2024, 1:16:22 PM)
