I understand, I want to turn this into a store, how do I turn it, I haven't finished the site yet, it doesn't appear in my funnels tab, I need tokens to make edits.

### sinan  (5/25/2024, 5:49:57 PM)

*token

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 5:52:05 PM)

Önerdiğiniz şey desteklenmiyor 

Sahip olduğunuz şey bir huni değil, bir Mağaza 

Mağazalar ve Huniler farklı sekmelerde bulunabilir

Bu, ürünlerin mağazalara eklendiği yerdir

### sinan  (5/25/2024, 5:54:10 PM)

Now I understand, do I need to add the products to the store manually? When I try to add the product with the help of mutualdropship, I get the warning that this product is already added, but the product is not added.

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 6:02:57 PM)

You can use Magnet app to import the product you want

### sinan  (5/25/2024, 6:06:00 PM)

is it possible you can add for me ?

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 6:06:20 PM)

Ah it's because in the app we don't support mutual dropship  importing

Applications like cjdropship automatically send incoming sales when doing dropshipping. I wonder if mutualdropship has this feature?

Hi there, 
After checking with the team, Yes, it will. Whenever you get sales, if you connect them with the product in mutual dropshipping, the order data will sync automatically. You can then handle, buy, and ship the product to the customer directly from the app.
