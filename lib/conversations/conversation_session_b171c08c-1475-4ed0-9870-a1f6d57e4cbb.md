Hello Hamza,
After checking with our team, the  31.98 USD is for upgrading the account (it was on January the first ), and the 11 USD is for your sales fees.

Hey Adam,

I have a question for the Dev team regarding Snapchat pixel implementation.

My Snap pixel gives me 2 errors (as you can see in the screenshot):
- Invalid phone number
- Invalid email address

I'm using Automated Matching and I think to get rid of the error I need the email and phone variables used in Lightfunnels.

Here is the pixel code:

<!-- Snap Pixel Code -->
<script type='text/javascript'>
(function(e,t,n){if(e.snaptr)return;var a=e.snaptr=function()
{a.handleRequest?a.handleRequest.apply(a,arguments):a.queue.push(arguments)};
a.queue=[];var s='script';r=t.createElement(s);r.async=!0;
r.src=n;var u=t.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
u.parentNode.insertBefore(r,u);})(window,document,
'https://sc-static.net/scevent.min.js');

snaptr('init', 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx', {
'user_email': '__INSERT_USER_EMAIL__'
});

snaptr('track', 'PAGE_VIEW');

</script>
<!-- End Snap Pixel Code -->

Hi there 
For tracking you don't need to add any script since they are already fired aatomatically you just need to install the pixel then link the pixel ID with your store or funnel

Hello 
I hope you're doing well

The order button on all my active funnels is not working today. The button just keeps loading (as you can see in the attachment). Customers are not directed to the thank you page where I track my conversions. 

This is hurting my ad campaign conversion data.

Can you fix this ASAP, please?

Thank you.
- Hamza.

Here is a funnel example: https://www.drucio.xyz/sakura-shampoo-UAE-TT

This is affecting all funnels in my account.

This is getting worse! now all my funnels don't even load and the platform
seems to be in maintenance.

I'm forced now to turn off all my active ad campaigns.

Hello
I hope you're doing well

I want to try the split test node to test 2 different offers.

I set up the split test node with 50% traffic weight for each variation (As you can see in the screenshot).

However, when I tested accessing the funnel from different IPs, the traffic weight attribution didn't seem to be 50% - 50%, but rather random.

Can you please explain to me how the split test node distributes traffic? Is it time-based, or IP-based...?

Funnel link: https://www.drucio.xyz/Retinol-Capsules-Split-KW-TT/

Thank you so much.
- Hamza.


Can you please
