All the funnels and the stores are not working, it's been more than 8 hours now. I just discovered it now. Why didn't you inform us about this malfunction? We've lost a very large amount of money on advertisements, and this is totally unacceptable

We are currently experiencing a service disruption that is affecting a limited number of users. Our team is working to identify the cause and restore full functionality as soon as possible.

Why didn't you inform us so we could stop the advertising campaigns? This is a significant financial loss. What are you going to do about this loss now?
