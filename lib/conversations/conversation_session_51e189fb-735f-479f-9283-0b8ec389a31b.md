### Giovanni Cichella (5/9/2024, 10:47:17 AM)

Yes but when I do that it says that I can't redirect my domain to itself

So the trick that I've found and it worked for one of my previous domain was to link it to https://shop.mylightfunnels.com

### Adam slam (5/9/2024, 10:49:05 AM)

you need to check with your domain provider , so they can  check it for you , you cant use any trick it will have the security issue with it , must do it right way ,

### Giovanni Cichella (5/9/2024, 10:50:10 AM)

Ok I understand that, actually they told me to do it like that but if it can cause security issue, let's delete the forwarding as it is optional. I don't have forwarding for my "www.radiental.com.mx" and it works fine

### Adam slam (5/9/2024, 10:52:06 AM)

to able to connect your domain without any issues must have the 2 settings connected fine

for this , user not setup our settings for his domain his domain provider not having the redirect option , he using workaround for the other domains he connect it here and its work , now the workaround not working , and he ask why 

Already told him , that need to setup the 2 settings to be able your domain working correctly otherwise you will face issue , he is not get it , so i ignored him

Hello,

Unfortunately, it's not possible to proceed the connection without following our instructions. If your domain does not have a redirect option, you'll need to change your domain provider. We do not provide any other options for this.

Additionally, any workarounds you may have used previously will not result in a trusted connection and are likely to cause issues.

Thank you for your understanding. If you have any further questions, please let us know.

Best regards,
