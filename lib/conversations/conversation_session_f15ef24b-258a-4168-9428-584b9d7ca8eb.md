https://app.lightfunnels.com/admin/dashboard

### Khalid souhal (5/18/2024, 4:29:24 PM)

Could you please fix the link on this two section inside Analytics Dashboard

### Khalid souhal (5/18/2024, 4:30:11 PM)

The TOP PRODUCTS, the href is missing an 'S' in the url, it should be /products/ instead of /product/

### Khalid souhal (5/18/2024, 4:30:35 PM)

And for TOP SELLING FUNNELS, there's an extra 'S' on a tag href

### Khalid souhal (5/18/2024, 4:31:00 PM)

/funnel/ instead of /funnels/

### Khalid souhal (5/18/2024, 4:31:22 PM)

It affect the experience on quickly accessing products and funnels

### Khalid souhal (5/18/2024, 4:31:26 PM)
