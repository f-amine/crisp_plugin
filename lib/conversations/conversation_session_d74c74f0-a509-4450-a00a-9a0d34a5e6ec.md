in case you need to import a product, you can use Magnet app 
You can just copy the link and add it here

I already created the product on lightfunnels so the sku just need to match

### Hristo Kehayov (5/25/2024, 4:45:25 PM)

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 4:46:31 PM)

> I already created the product on lightfunnels so the sku just need to match
yes for the syncing to work the SKUs should match 

In case the order was not synced, or you get any errors, please share with me, so I can forward to dev to check

can i apply discount % on upsell without creating the same product with reduced price?

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 5:20:16 PM)

Unfortunately, that will not be possible 
You can either add the product as reduced price as you said 
Or add a bundle offer when the product has a discount

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 5:48:56 PM)
