We haven't received any reports regarding issues with the Souk theme from the email address miwanxc@gmail.com. Additionally, based on the screenshot provided, it appears that our communication with you has been limited to this single conversation.

Thus far, we haven't received any information regarding the significant problem you've mentioned with the Souk theme. The description you've provided lacks specificity, and it seems the issue might be more related to a store or funnel rather than the theme itself. Until you provide more detailed information, or if you've contacted us from a different email address, we won't be able to offer assistance. If you've reported the issue from another email address, please let us know so we can continue the conversation there.

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/15/2024, 10:19:21 PM)

the issue can't be related to the theme, that's what I'm trying to make you understand

if it was theme related, we will have at least two other  complaints about the same issue 

before embedding a template, we test it many times before adding it 


if you can send me more links of the funnels with the issue, it will help us gather more input on what's causing the issue

### mohamed lamrabt (5/15/2024, 10:21:37 PM)

and as i told you before you will just say the same thing that you said every day we coplain about this issue we send you a screen video from 3 diffrents phones and you still saying the same thing you and other support agents

### mohamed lamrabt (5/15/2024, 10:22:19 PM)

i don't care if someone does complain about ti or not we complain about it we have clarity video screens of our clients quits while they scrolling and the landing page glitched

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/15/2024, 10:22:21 PM)

We're committed to resolving any issues you're facing, rather than getting caught up in arguments. If possible, could you please share the links to the funnels encountering problems? This will allow us to swiftly pass them on to our team for investigation and provide you with a solution as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation!

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/15/2024, 10:29:44 PM)

Rest assured, no tickets go unnoticed, and we sincerely apologize for any delay in resolving them
You're welcome to explore other templates as well; there's no obligation to stick with the Souk template. Our priority is to address any concerns you may have. Please send us the active links, and ensure they remain accessible so we can promptly investigate them.
