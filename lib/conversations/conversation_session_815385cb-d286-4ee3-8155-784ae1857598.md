Hi Aresto !

We apologize for the inconvenience with the previous promo code. But fret not! We've got you covered with one alternative promo code: GTXALWNGGT


Simply head over to this link: https://visit.gitexafrica.com/  log in, and add the coupon during checkout.

Once you're at Gitex, show them your phone so they can scan the invite, and you'll receive your badge hassle-free!

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards
