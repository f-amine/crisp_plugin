hello i have a question about the size of the thumbnail images whats the ideal size because when i add images it appear not good

### Yousra Chanaoui (4/29/2024, 8:06:59 PM)

Hi Hamza while we don't have an ideal size you can go with 550*550 px also to avoid images from being cropped or zoomed in all images should have the same value
