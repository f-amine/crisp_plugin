**Assistance Needed for Linking Domain Name "elasri.ma" from Capconnect**

Dear Lightfunnels Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well.
I am encountering an issue while attempting to link my domain name "
elasri.ma," which I purchased from the provider Capconnect. I have been
following the instructions provided for Namecheap and GoDaddy, but they do
not seem to work with Capconnect.

Could you please guide me on how to configure and set up the domain to be
compatible with your platform using Capconnect? Any detailed instructions
or steps you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
NB: Gmail linked to my  lightfunnels: ask.elasri@gmail.com
