hi light funnel team  how are you ? 
I am the owner of an American brand,
With Shopfi shop it has been operating for 3 years.
I liked your tool and we want to start doing a series of tests for the different panels,
For this purpose, I need your help in understanding how to make the connection in the best way between our Shopee store and your panel.
questions
1) Our shopify store is now connected to the 3pl server that will take care of sending the products to final customers.
- As soon as I connected the store with the product to the panels, do you still need to define a shipping cost and a rate on your panels?

2) Connection domain - I followed the instructions - asking you to confirm that it works.

3) Cart abandonment emails + thank you emails - we have Kloyoyo,
How would you recommend building this setup - I want the emails sent through this panel to be different from the emails in the klaviyo sent to the store's customers..

How would you recommend to act?

4) Connection of PayPal + credit that we wanted to buy..
how ?

5) What about documents such as policies + policy documents that appear in your area under the legal section...

I have our privacy + product return policy in the store. Do I have to enter these files manually?
