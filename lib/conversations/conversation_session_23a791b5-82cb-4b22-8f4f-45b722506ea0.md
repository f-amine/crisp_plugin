the order for the funnelsreference that i sent you are associated to the product in the funnels so their value is 0 and they have no product associated to them , they only have the contact informations

### Anass Karad (4/15/2024, 7:07:45 PM)

so can you please associate all the order that has been ordered on the funnel with the product in the funnels

### Anass Karad (4/15/2024, 7:08:00 PM)

Hi there, 
If you want to get an order, it gets transferred to CODPartner. You only need to connect your CODPartner account with Lightfunnels by following the steps mentioned in this link

Unfortunately, that option isn't available at the moment. These are the only apps we have currently for cash on delivery : https://www.lightfunnels.com/apps?category=COD

its not an app, its just a code, you only have to add it to the header and it transfers automaticly the leads
