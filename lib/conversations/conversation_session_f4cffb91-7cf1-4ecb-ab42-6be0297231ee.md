Etki alanını Huni ile bağlamanız gerekir


Bu şekilde, sümüklü böceğe ihtiyaç duyulmayacaktır 



Telefon için özel bir kod olarak ekleyebilir veya bağlantıyı yapışkan sohbet bölümüne ekleyebilirsiniz

of course

You need to link the domain with a home Funnel


That way, no slug will be needed 



For the phone, you can add it as a custom code or add the link in the sticky chat section
