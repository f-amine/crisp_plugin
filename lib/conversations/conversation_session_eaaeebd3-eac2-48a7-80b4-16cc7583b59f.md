Can i suggest a feature? Most people are suffering from daly of GA4 and FB reports
If we can offer UTMs as an option to export in Sheets and other intergrations so that us can do their pivot tables to track realtime conversions, it'd be amazing

### Adam slam (11/29/2023, 1:44:49 PM)

Thank you for share your suggestion i will pass it to our team for upcoming updates

Hello, I got many compalints about a form bug which doesn't accept Arabic numbers and refuses to submit the order, can you please fix it as it's a hidden bug we can't find till some clients report it as the input itself accepts arabic numbers in some browsers only, i tried myself to write arabic numbers in it but i couldn't but this attached screenshot from my client's phone shows that some phones allows arabic numbers then gives the error on submit
