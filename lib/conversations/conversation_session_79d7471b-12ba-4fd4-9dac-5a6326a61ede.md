We take all billing concerns seriously, and I would like to assure you that our billing team will investigate this issue for you. In order to assist me with the investigation, I would kindly ask you to provide proof of billing. 

This could be a copy of your bank statement or a screenshot of the multiple charges on your billing statement.

Hi there, 
Could you please ensure that the double charge doesn't pertain to the same invoice? You can find invoices details in the account settings

Hi there, 
I've checked with our billing team, and the charges you received are not a double charge

the invoice for April 24th is the invoice you have pending when you cancel your subscription, it was marked as paid when you resumed your subscription
the invoice for April 12th : current subscription
