I think there‚Äôs some wonky data hung up in your browser. Can you try clearing your cache, cookies, and restarting it?

If it‚Äôs still a no-go after that, can you try a different browser? That‚Äôll help me rule in/out the browser as the culprit here.

If this doesn‚Äôt work or you have more questions, just let me know, and I‚Äôll be happy to help!
