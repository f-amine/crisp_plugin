Hi there, Hope you're doing well!
Recently I had some problems with the google sheet app and some orders don't sync automatically to the sheet until I copy and paste them manually.
Could you please help me to fix this problem and thanks for your time,
regards.

Hi there, hope you're doing well.
Could you please tell me if it's possible to change the format of google sheets phone number syncing; for example when the customer fills out the form he filled it like this ( 0540XXXXXX) but when the order synced to google sheet the country code will be added to the phone number for example if the customer is from Algeria it will shown ( +213540XXXXXX),
So could you please tell me if can change this and the number will shown like the format that the customer typed in the form.
Best Regards,
Ouail Zarour.
