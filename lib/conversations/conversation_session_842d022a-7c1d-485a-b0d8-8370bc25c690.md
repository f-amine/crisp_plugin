Hi, I would like to set a default value for the mobile number section so the customer can enter only 10 numbers how can I do that?

### Yousra Chanaoui (6/9/2023, 8:30:29 PM)

Unfortunately that's not possible, to make sure your customers are providing you with the correct phone number make sure this is turned off
