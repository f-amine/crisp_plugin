Hi there, 
The countdown starts counting the moment you enter the page 

It continues to count even when you leave the page

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/16/2024, 5:32:11 PM)

You can't make it start at zero each time it reaches zero

so , thats mean there is no way to make it start counting again when customer open page,, :(, the problem once it reaches 0 then if some other customer open that page it still shows 0,(That's the main problem), Counter should be running when customer open page.
