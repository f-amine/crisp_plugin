**Account and bills**

Hello. I opened a lightfunnels account from my ekremguven3826@gmail.com
account. I don't know how to use your interface yet, so I created another
account without realising it. And 10 dollars membership fee was withdrawn
from this account. But I will not use this account. I will use the store
called down cowbow. I request that the other account be closed and the 10
dollars be refunded. The name of the account I want to close is pitch lead.
I would appreciate your help.

i dont think you are able to get refund since you are creating the account and its shows to you that it will cost you additional amount for it , it will share your case with our billing team to check if they can help you with it

### Adam slam (5/25/2024, 11:37:31 AM)
