I attempted to change the background color of the navbar to white in the section displayed in the screenshot. However, when I activate dark mode, I am unable to see the change in my funnel.

But you mentioned earlier that there was a solution for this problem just four hours ago! It would be great if you could reach out to the developer or someone who can help, as we have been receiving numerous messages from clients regarding this issue and unfortunately, we are losing many of them.

### hafsa BOUALLI (4/24/2024, 1:58:00 PM)

Apologies for any inconvenience caused. We've already checked with our team, but unfortunately, it's not possible at the moment
thank you for your understanding
