Yes, but that e-mail belongs to a former employee. And he's no longer with us. I don't want someone who works for us to have their e-mail on my dashboard. It's not safe.

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/9/2024, 8:05:00 PM)

You can change the password 

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/9/2024, 8:05:06 PM)

Once the password is changed 

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/9/2024, 8:05:19 PM)

Nobody can log in

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/9/2024, 8:05:27 PM)

He will be logged out automatically

I've already done that. My password is different now, but I don't want my dashboard to show the email of someone who doesn't work for my company.

### Ana Hesap (5/9/2024, 8:06:38 PM)

This should not be difficult for you to handle.

### Ana Hesap (5/9/2024, 8:08:02 PM)

I like working with you, but it is not nice to waste so much time for such a simple problem. It's just an e-mail, and I don't want that e-mail to be there.

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/9/2024, 8:13:13 PM)

I totally understand you. It's just that I prefer being careful with this type of issue and waiting for the proper help 


That way, it can be resolved in the best way possible

Yousra, all access, main e-mail, password, management of this account belongs to me and my e-mails. â€˜â€™Milyonercampus@gmail.comâ€˜â€™ His account is not currently authorised to do anything with my LightFunnels panel.  The main mail of the account belongs to me now as you can see. What exactly do you want me to do now?
