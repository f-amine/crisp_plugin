hello I placed an ad now but the visitors are not showing up. Can you check if there is a problem with the pixel?

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/16/2024, 1:50:19 PM)

Hi there, 
Did you please follow all the steps to link the pixel with your store or funnel?  

1- Add the pixel ID code in the tracking section in the setting for the account 
2- Go to the setting inside the funnel or the store that you want then choose the pixel that you want
