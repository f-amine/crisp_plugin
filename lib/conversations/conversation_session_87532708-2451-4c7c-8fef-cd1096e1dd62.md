No, you must open my account immediately. Did I send you the payment receipt? If it is not paid, close my account immediately. I also sent the receipt from your website.

### Joseph Comart (5/26/2024, 6:21:17 PM)

I applied before and you dismissed it like this. If you're not going to help me, why are you here?

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/26/2024, 6:24:30 PM)

I'm sorry for the trouble you're facing. I've already escalated this to our billing team for investigation since I can't resolve it from my side

Your billing team is not helpful at all. All they have to do is open the fucking account. I paid $10 and they still didn't open it. My account was locked last month.

### Joseph Comart (5/26/2024, 6:29:13 PM)

And you probably think it's stupid that I cry so much over chewing gum and ten dollars, which is important to me. You will stop answering me.

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/26/2024, 6:30:24 PM)

I’m sorry for the frustration, I’ve informed the billing team again and stressed that your account needs to be opened immediately. Once I get an answer from them, I’ll let you know. thank you for your patience

You said before that you would inform me, but you did not inform me. But Hafsa, you are a good person, your salary should be increased.
