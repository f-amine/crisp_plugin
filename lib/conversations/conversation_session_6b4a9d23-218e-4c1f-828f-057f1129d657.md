**equest a refund for my LiteFunnel account ( contact.saidcod@gmail.com )**

Dear LiteFunnel Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is hamza , and I am writing to
request a refund for my LiteFunnel account ( contact.saidcod@gmail.com ) ,
which was mistakenly charged despite my previous cancellation attempts. I I
am a loyal customer, managing two stores with you under the email addresses
marocluxe05@gmail.com and contact.kamalcod@gmail.com

Here are the key points of my request:

No Usage of the Account: I have not used the account in question at all
times. Despite my non-usage, my account was still deducted, which I believe
was an error.

Subscription Cancellation Issues: I had previously canceled my
subscription, but it appears that the cancellation was not processed
successfully, resulting in continued charges.

Loyal Customer: As a loyal customer with two active stores under your
platform, I have always valued the services LiteFunnel provides. However,
this recent issue has been a cause for concern, and I hope we can resolve
it promptly.

Given these points, I kindly request a full refund for the charges made
post-cancellation. I appreciate your understanding and assistance in
resolving this matter swiftly.

Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to your
 response.
