No, it is not going on now, but you told me that you are still working on it, but you also told me that you are working on the website speed because I have some speed problems in my funnel and stores. website optimization would not be bad, frankly.

### Cem Eren Demir (4/23/2024, 9:59:15 PM)

Can I ask you for a funnel template, I really like bleame's store, can you bring me a template similar to his store? dropy yes it's a bit similar but it's missing a lot to be honest.

### Cem Eren Demir (4/23/2024, 9:59:30 PM)

good evening
