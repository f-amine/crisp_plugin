**Credit card (deletion) and a refund / Lifetime deal**

Hello,

i added a store that i did not use at all to the shop because I could not
delete the other one, you blocked my account and charged me for the extra
store.

i contacted the support to get my account back and they said I had to pay
with a credit card I replied I did not have it and he said you can get a
friend`s credit card and pay which I  eventually did.

now I want you please to delete the credit card of my friend from my
account, it is not mine.

it has been more than 15 days that I am waiting for an answer.

best regards.
