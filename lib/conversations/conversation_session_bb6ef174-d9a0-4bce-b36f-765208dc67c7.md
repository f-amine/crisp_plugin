I created a store and I want it to be linked to the main domain which is thegadgetinspector.com BUT i don't want to use different domain to the funnels, I just want them to have like subdomain of this main domain

### Chay Chay (5/24/2024, 8:57:10 AM)

Hi there, 
You can try to make a subdomain from your domain provider and then try to connect it with the account

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/24/2024, 9:29:08 AM)

Then connect it with funnel section

It's not working

### Chay Chay (5/24/2024, 2:26:44 PM)

And already contacted the domain provider but all what they did didn't work

### Chay Chay (5/24/2024, 2:27:13 PM)

I also used the extension provided by lightfunnels to make the set up and still not working
