I was charged $10 for a ridiculous reason, and my store is locked. either give me my money or open my store

### Joseph Comart (5/26/2024, 3:53:56 PM)

can't you open it?

### Joseph Comart (5/26/2024, 3:56:36 PM)

I understand your concern. Unfortunately, I can't reopen the store directly. To reactivate your account, pending invoices need to be settled. If these invoices were paid by mistake, you'll receive a refund. 

Your refund request is already with our billing team for review. We'll keep you updated. Thank you for your patience.

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/26/2024, 4:02:44 PM)

i completely understand your urgency and concern. Your refund request has been forwarded to our billing team. Once I receive a response from them, I will promptly update you
