Thank you a lot for responding I managed to solve the issue regarding the
multiple orders, but can fix why the support chat is not appearing in my
lightfunnels dashboard

I see there is 10 massages in the notification near the website icon but
the chat itself is gone

firstly the support chat does not appear on my dashboard, i want to contact
you guys about a serious problem regarding my website, every time a
customer tries to buy a product it always buys him the regardless of the
product that he ordered, for example he order product number 9 it will
always purchase product number 1, if he purchased product number 12 it will
also buy him product number 1
