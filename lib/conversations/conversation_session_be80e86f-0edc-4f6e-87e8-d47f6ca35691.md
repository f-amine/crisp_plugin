Hi Houssam, 
Could you please share how long it takes for the leads to sync to Google Sheets?

Typically, a 1 hour delay in syncing leads is normal due to the high volume of requests. Sometimes, the API crash causing further delay

1 hour is actually too much because it affects the confirmation rate, i've
being using Lf for quite sometime and this is the first time facing this
issue

i will share your feedback with our team to check it for you. but it's normal for this to happen sometimes to ensure all data syncs correctly without missing anything
