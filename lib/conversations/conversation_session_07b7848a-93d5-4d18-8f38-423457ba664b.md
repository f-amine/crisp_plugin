Submitting your app just got easier!

Hi there, We noticed that you have built an app on the Square Developer
Platform but are not part of theSquare App Marketplace
<https://squareup.com/app-marketplace> yet. We wanted to let you know that
we've improved our app submission and review experience, enabling you to
self-onboard, complete an integration check, and submit your app to Square!




Get started <https://developer.squareup.com/docs/app-marketplace>


Here's what you can expect:






Streamlined app submission process
Any developer or company that has integrated an app with Square can now
initiate the app submission process from within their Square Developer account.
From the ‘App Marketplace’ tab, you can select your application and click ‘New
submission’.



Improved requirements check and testing
Prior to submitting to Square for testing, you will enter a new self-guided
requirements check which will validate that your app meets our API Usage
Requirements.



Enhanced status tracking and notes
Real-time status updates on your app review are now available directly within
your Square Developer account. You can collaborate further with Square via a
new Notes feature that centralizes all communications within your submission.



Earn a revenue share on referrals
Any developer who self-onboards and publishes an app to the Square App
Marketplace is eligible to receive a revenue share for any sellers they refer
to Square.


If you're interested in submitting an app to the Square App Marketplace, we
encourage you to try this new experience today.
