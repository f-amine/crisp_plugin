The steps in the video didn't work with me , how to add pricing accordingly
to regions

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/24/2024, 8:08:12 PM)

The shipping only works with countries not cities and regions, therefore you can't add shipping based on regions

In the video you linked me , which i already watched before emailing you, i
saw an example of Saudi Arabia and they got the option of choosing cities ,
why it isnt the case for Algeria?

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/24/2024, 9:03:26 PM)

Please send me where you have seen shipping based on cities for Saudi Arabia

What you have requested is how to add shipping based on region, then price for each region which is not supported 

The video shows a list of regions added.. you can 
Please rewatch the video we shared to get a clear idea of what advanced shipping is and how it works.


To use advanced shipping option, you need to upload a CSV file of the regions you want to use within your stores and funnels 

Those regions will be displayed in the address field when auto complete is enabled.

Shipping and advanced shipping are two different things that should not be mixed since each works differently.

Hi there, 
After adding the regions, you only need to ensure that you use a 'select' element on your checkout page and the correct information from the ''select'' settings so that the regions appear
 
for the second question, Could you please provide more details about the issue and send a screenshot to help us understand better?

Thank you for the first part , eveything worked fine
Thus , for the second issue , the thing is that i can't add shipping
pricing for each region , which means shipping pricings according to each
region

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/25/2024, 11:50:31 PM)

Unfortunately, that's not possible at the moment

Let me explain further , as many users of lightfunnels do , we work with
COD in Algeria , so there are many Cities (58) and the shipping fees differ
from a city to another , therefore we made a list for the customers to
choose their city , we need to add shipping prices for each city

I understand the importance of this feature for you. Adding shipping prices for each city or region is not supported yet, I will share your feedback with our team for future updates <3
