I will shut down my entire system as soon as possible and tell all my friends what a terrible system you have. If you cannot do this job in Turkey, do not make empty promises to people!!!!!!

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/14/2024, 2:15:25 PM)

I understand your frustration and I apologize for any inconvenience. I'll do my best to address your concerns promptly.

There are errors in the translations on my checkout page. When I enter my credit card information, installment options appear. It should continue as 1 installment, 2 installments.... However, it says 1 installments 2 installments. In other words, the LER part is not a part that has an equivalent in Turkish.

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/14/2024, 7:57:26 PM)

funnel or store name, please

You need to remove the trailing 'LER' part.

### Marn Grup (5/15/2024, 7:22:56 PM)

for example 
1 Taksit
2 Taksit
3 Taksit
4 Taksit
5 Taksit
.
