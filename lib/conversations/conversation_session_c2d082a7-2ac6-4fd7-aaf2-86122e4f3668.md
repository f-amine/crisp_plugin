**Hello, I am Umut Kugucak. I am writing to you from my registered uk.csgfunnels@gmail.com e-mail address.**

I want to create a track my order page, but I did not see an application
related to it. There was an application called Track123 on Shopify. I was
using it. Do you have such an application as well? Or can I achieve this
with Woocommerce? When I entered the Woocommerce site, I did not see a
plugin related to Lightfunnels. Can you help me?

To make tracking page follow the steps 

1- Copy this code from here: https://justpaste.it/a4npv , then go to the page you want the tracker to be in, select a section and (cmd +v) or (ctrl + v) to paste it

2-  go copy this other code from here: https://justpaste.it/a7685 and paste it in the "Page Settings" custom HTML input.

and there you'll have a ready to go order tracker üòÅ
