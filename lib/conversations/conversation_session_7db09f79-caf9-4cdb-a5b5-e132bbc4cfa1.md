### hafsa BOUALLI (5/23/2024, 4:13:40 PM)

You only need to go to your product page, select the discount and edit or remove it from there

do ı need to make same action for each product or there is a page that can make everything automatically (arrange discount ratios)

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/23/2024, 4:20:59 PM)

If you're using a store, there's no need to perform the same action for each product, you just need to edit the product page that displays this discount, and the edit will appear on all your products
