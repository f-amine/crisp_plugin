I have checked, No, you cannot edit an XML file directly on the Google app. However, you can use Google Drive to upload the XML file and then open it with Google Docs for simple edits. For more advanced editing, you can use third-party apps like QuickEdit, Acode, or Dcoder from the Google Play Store.

Hi Abdellah, 
After checking with the team, could you please explain what do you mean by '' edited xml file'' 

The file gets updated automatically with new data from products, so you don't need to do anything. However, it may take a few minutes for it to update
