**Ligfunnels supplier problem**

Hello, i am a Ligfunnels user.

Are you considering making agreements with companies such as shepbear
or grs Drops?

Ligfunnels is the infrastructure that I like very much, but many
people do not want to use it because there is a supply problem.

Ligfunnels is a much better and more useful infrastructure than Shopify.

The only problem is mutual, CJ dropshipping is not enough and you need
to make an agreement with other Chinese agencies (Shepbear, GSR
dropshipping) this is a big problem.

I ask you to disregard these things.
