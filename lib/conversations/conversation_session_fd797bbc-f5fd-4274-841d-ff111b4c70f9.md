Fantastic! Just to double-check, the header is the correct location for the code, right? 

And is there an alternative location where I could place the Body code for the Tag Manager, or is it strictly confined to the header?

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/10/2024, 12:34:38 PM)

For GTM you need to use just the header

### hafsa BOUALLI (5/10/2024, 12:34:49 PM)

In case you want to use the body script too, you can add it below the header code
