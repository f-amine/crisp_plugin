My funnel is working fine no technical issues; however, when I recorded the vsitors using Clarity app, I found out the visitors are struggeling to zoom in espcially when chekcing the product. 

I know the mobile version gives the user image preview but still it is not the best practics and I found out most of them simple leave the page.

Yes, I am fully aware of this option, still the bounce rate is very high due to the issue.

I would be great if the team could urgently implement this feature as it very badly affecting the conversion rate.
