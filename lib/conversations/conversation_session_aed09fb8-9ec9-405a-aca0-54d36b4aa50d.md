Hello can I get quick and serious help about my facebook conversion pixel
integration?
I previously connected about this and I seem to have an issue.
[image: image.png]
I get this error.
Even though for several times I did the pixel attaining, both from main
settings and on funnel settings.

It is not recognized. This is not because of Meta. Its something about
Lightfunnels side. Also extensions don't show that there are any pixels on
the page.

Why is this, how to fix it?
I need this to be able to give ads!
Help URGENTLY please.
Thank you

It’s a cookies policy thingy, you just need to click on the “admit it” and you’ll be good.  Also, make sure to disable ad blocker in your browser while testing it

**variant versus bundle select button**

Hello, I want to use the variant options for different packages under my
product set. But the variant select button ads an extra step of friction,
showing wrong product than what was selected.
As in the video:

https://vimeo.com/950694666/952fb93fed?share=copy

Can you please guide me or remove that extra step so people can flow
through the payment process easier?

Thank you.
