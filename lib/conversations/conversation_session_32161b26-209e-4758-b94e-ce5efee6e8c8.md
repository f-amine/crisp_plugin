Hi Yousra,

Our webhook, which syncs new orders to our order management system, hasn't been triggering for about 5 hours despite new orders coming in.

Here are the recent orders that didn't trigger:

order_IGNsfqeb-3MDHr506Aep4
order_fae4VleYt9L0IzBNBuD12
order_KNg-x1cXj8ktV0d9AB08L

Hey Lightfunnels Team,

We wanted to reach out and share a couple of suggestions that we think could make the platform even better, especially for businesses like ours that manage multiple languages and stores.
First, we think it would be super useful if you could add a new column in the products List page that shows where each product is published (funnel or store). This would make it much easier for us to recognize products and their corresponding languages, since we handle multiple language versions of our site.
Also, we noticed that the AI translation tool for product descriptions is missing some important languages that are key for our target markets. We would love to see you add more languages, especially Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak, Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Croatian, Slovenian, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian. Having these languages available in the AI translation tool would save us a lot of time and effort in creating localized content.
We believe these additions would not only benefit our business but also many other sellers who are targeting different markets and languages.
Thanks for considering our suggestions. We're excited to see how Lightfunnels continues to improve.

Keep up the great work!

Thank you

Hello LF Team,

I tried to upload some GIFs ( about 10MB each)  for use in the product description, but I received a message stating that the maximum file size I can upload is 5MB. However, according to the Standard plan, I should be able to upload files up to 1GB.


Can you help me with that? 


Thank you

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/16/2024, 11:36:03 PM)

The gif should be under 5Mb

If it exceeds those limits, you will not be able to upload it.

Hello LF Team,

I have an issue with the bundle offer. Our products already have a 30% discount applied, reflected in the compared price. We aim to provide customers with an additional 10% discount if they buy 2 items and an additional 20% discount if they buy 3 items (using bundle offer) .

However, when setting up the bundle, the compared price shown for the single item choice is the same as the discounted price (after 30% off). Instead, it should display the original price before the 30% discount is applied.

Could you please assist with this?

Attached are screenshots for clarification!

Thank you for your support.

When creating bundles 
What is the discounted value you added for the first offer?

### Ayoub Mghyly (5/25/2024, 1:36:14 AM)

.

### Yousra Chanaoui (5/25/2024, 1:36:18 AM)

In case the discounted value is zero 

The price in bundles will equal the compare price

We have already informed our customers that we offer a 30% discount at the product level. The bundle offer is meant to provide an additional discount on top of this. Additionally, the summary includes the 30% discount we provide at the product level, which creates a mismatch in the pricing.

Please note that in all e-commerce platforms, the compared price for the first offer should be the compared price we set in the product editing section (see attached). Alternatively, for the first item in the bundle, if there is no additional offer for that quantity, the compared price should not be shown, as it is the same as the selling price.

Informing users about a 30% discount is not part of setting up bundles 


As mentioned, if the offer has a 0 in the discount value in bundles 

Price= compare price 

In case you want to display a specific compare price, then you will need to add another discounted value 

We have already reported to the team about removing the compare price from bundles. When this option gets added, we will let you know 


Thank you for your honest feedback

The compared price should be the total price before all bundles and discounts. This is basic in commerce and marketing :)

As I mentioned before, we don't have this problem in the summary. So what the team needs to do is apply the same principle in bundles :)
