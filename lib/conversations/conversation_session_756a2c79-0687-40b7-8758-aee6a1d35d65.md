**[TEST] Follow-Up on Recent Service Shortage**

Dear [First Name]

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to follow up
on the service shortage issue that affected some user accounts two
days ago. We quickly located the issue and worked on the fix
immediately.

Since then, our team has dedicated the past two days to ensuring this
won't happen again. TheÂ disruption was due to some new updates and
features we are working on, which are set to be game changers,
significantly improving the Lightfunnels platform.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and
appreciate your patience and understanding. Rest assured, we are
committed to preventing such issues with future updates.

If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't
hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Thank you for your continued support.
