Hello Yousra
Thank you so much for your email and for your feedback.
Yes it was a horrible experience we lost lot of money that night.
My question for you is. Is there any future changes to COD partner
integration process? Because right now itâ€™s so difficult we have to create
for each currency a new account is there any taught to create only one
account and the currency detected automatically when the order is
transformed.
Thank you
