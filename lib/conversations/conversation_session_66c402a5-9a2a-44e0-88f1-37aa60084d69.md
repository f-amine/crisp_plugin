Hey!
Thank you for reaching out to the Lightfunnels support team!

I think there’s some wonky data hung up in your browser. Can you try clearing your cache, cookies, and restarting it?

If it’s still a no-go after that, can you try a different browser? That’ll help me rule in/out the browser as the culprit here.

If this doesn’t work or you have more questions, just let me know, and I’ll be happy to help!
