## Redirecting Visitors to Specific Funnels Based on Location

### Overview
Lightfunnels allows you to redirect visitors to specific funnels based on their geographic location. This guide explains how to configure these redirects and provides steps for troubleshooting common issues.

### Configuring Redirects

1. **Setting Up Funnels:**
   - **Hidden Funnel:** A funnel that will only be accessible to visitors from specific countries.
   - **Public Funnel:** A funnel accessible to visitors from all other countries.

2. **Default Configuration:**
   - Visitors from Saudi Arabia will be redirected to the hidden funnel.
   - Visitors from all other countries will access the public funnel.

### Example Configuration

- **Hidden Funnel URL:** `https://www.example.com/hidden-funnel`
- **Public Funnel URL:** `https://www.example.com/public-funnel`

In your ads or direct links, use the public funnel URL (`https://www.example.com/public-funnel`).
