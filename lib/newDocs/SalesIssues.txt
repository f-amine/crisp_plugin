### Low Sales Conversion
If you are experiencing low sales conversion compared to other platforms like Shopify, consider the following:

1. **Traffic Source**: Ensure that the traffic coming to your store is targeted and relevant.
2. **Checkout Process**: There might be issues in the checkout process affecting conversions.
   - Use tools like Microsoft Clarity to track customer behavior and identify potential problems.
   - Look for issues like complicated navigation, slow loading times, or errors in the checkout process.
3. **Ad Campaigns**: Review your ad campaigns to ensure they are optimized for the platform.
   - Compare the performance metrics of your campaigns on different platforms.
